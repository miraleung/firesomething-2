And there was a <em>great commotion</em> among the believers and nonbelievers alike, 
for they saw a <em>great fox</em> of <em class="f">fire</em> and knew not its true nature. But just then a 
faithful believer <em>extended</em> his hand, and offered a gift to the fiery fox. And 
the fox was enabled to show its true nature as an <em>ever-changing being</em>, and it 
turned into a great <em>oyster</em> of <em>power</em>. And the oyster opened its shell, revealing 
a <em>dazzling pearl</em> to all who would look upon it.
